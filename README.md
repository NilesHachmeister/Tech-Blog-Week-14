## Usage

Inorder for the user to be able to use the website they will need to click login, then sign up instead, and create an account. After they have an account they are able to login. On the home page they are able to click on posts which will pull up the comments and give them the ability to comment themselves. When they go to their dashboard they are able to see their own posts. When they are on the dashboard and click on their own post they are able to edit or delete it. When the user is done using the webiste they are able to logout by clicking logout in the navbar.
